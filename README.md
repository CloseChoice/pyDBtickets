# DB Train Tickets
## Description
This module provides functionality to detect and read TrainTickets from German operator Deutsche Bahn, extracts information like ticket price or travel date and saves this information to an excel sheet.
Furthermore the ticket itself is moved to a folder containing tickets and bills. This is a useful tool for frequent travellers and people who can expense their travel costs.
